# A1 App Foundry: The Startup Beast Builder 🚀

A1 App Foundry is an elite "app factory" that generates production-ready, luxury-grade (A1) full-stack applications. It transforms a startup pitch into a complete monorepo including Frontend, Backend, Database, and AWS Infrastructure.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo + pnpm
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router) + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: NestJS (Node.js) + OpenAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma (with multi-tenancy support)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK (IaC)

## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- pnpm (v8 or higher)
- Docker (for database and previewing)

### 2. Installation
Install all dependencies from the root directory:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root or in specific packages as needed. The Foundry platform requires a PostgreSQL database.

You can start a local PostgreSQL instance using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Running the Foundry
You can run the entire platform (Web + API) using a single command:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
- **Web UI**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:3001/api`

### 5. Generating an App
1. Open the Web UI.
2. Enter your startup pitch in the "Project Wizard".
3. Review the AI-generated Blueprint.
4. Click **Build & Deploy**.
5. The generated code will appear in the `generated/` directory.

## 📦 Project Structure
- `apps/foundry-web`: The Next.js dashboard and wizard.
- `apps/foundry-api`: The NestJS orchestrator.
- `packages/generator`: The core templating and code emission engine.
- `packages/infra`: Shared AWS CDK constructs.
- `packages/db`: Prisma schema and database client.

## 🛡 A1 Luxury Standard
Every app generated by the Foundry includes:
- **Security**: RBAC, secure headers, audit logs.
- **Observability**: Structured logging and metrics hooks.
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.
- **AWS Infra**: Production-grade VPC, ECS Fargate, RDS, and S3 setup.

## 🧪 Testing
Run tests across the entire monorepo:
```bash
pnpm test
```

Generated apps are 100% exportable and follow industry roadmaps for Frontend, Backend, DevOps, and AWS.
